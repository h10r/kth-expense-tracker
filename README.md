This project is based on AngularJS and the angular seed structure. In order for this to run you need a local web server. 

If you're using MacOSX / Linux, you can simply run:

Python 3:

python -m http.server

Python 2:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

on the terminal in the ./app folder.

OR 

use XAMPP/MAMP/LAMP for Windows, Mac or Linux respectively

### Important: 

At the moment there is no backend implemented, when the app is refreshed all settings and entered expenes are lost. In order to populate the app with some data, we created a couple of dummy entries in the expensesModel. They can be hidden by commenting out the appropriate lines.
