This project is based on AngularJS and the angular seed structure. In order for this to run you need a local web server. 

If you're using MacOSX / Linux, you can simply run:

Python 3:

python -m http.server

Python 2:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

on the terminal in the ./app folder.

OR 

use XAMPP/MAMP/LAMP for Windows, Mac or Linux respectively

### Hosted Version

A hosted version of the app can be found here: [idontmind.de](http://idontmind.de/expt/app/)

### Compatbility:

The app is 'optimized' for use on iPhone. Although as a web app it should in theory run on any smartphone, there can be flawed css renderings, because of not supported CSS3 features or ommitted prefixes.


### Important: 

At the moment there is no backend implemented, when the app is refreshed all settings and entered expenes are lost. In order to populate the app with some data, we created a couple of dummy entries in the expensesModel. They can be hidden by commenting out the appropriate lines.
